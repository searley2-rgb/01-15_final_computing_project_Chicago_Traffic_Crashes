        <h3>Lighting and Weather Frequency</h3>
         <div class="col mx-auto"><embed src="/Users/shannonearley/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-searley2@nd.edu/Shared drives/Principles of Computing/visualizations/light_weather_tree.html"
                type="text/html" height="500" width="800"></div>
        <p>Traffic crashes are distributed across different lighting and weather conditions, particually concentrated during daylight
            and clear weather conditions. This pattern suggests that crash frequency is driven more by traffic volume and exposure than by poor weather alone, 
            since more driving occurs during these "normal" conditions. Crashes during darkness on lighted roads still make up a substantial portion of crashes, highlithging the added risk with
            reduced visibility even when street lighting is presnet. Meanwhile, crashes during rain and snow while, less frequent overall, remain meaningful contributors to risk, emphasizing how adverse conditions
            can pose as threats to drivers.</p>
        <h3>Trafficway Type</h3>
        <div class="col mx-auto"><embed src="/Users/shannonearley/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-searley2@nd.edu/Shared drives/Principles of Computing/visualizations/trafficway_pie.html"
                type="text/html" height="500" width="800"></div>
        
        <p>Crash occurances can be broken down into the five most common trafficway types in Chicago. Nearly two-thirds of traffic crashes take place on non-divided roadways, highlighting the elevated risk 
            on standard city streets without physical seperation between directions of travel. Four way intersections account for a significant share of crashes, reflecting the conflict points created by crossing traffic and turning movements.
        Parking lots account for a noticible share of crahes, suggesting that while speeds are lower, complex vehicle movements and driver distraction pose as potential risk for crashes. In contrast, divided roadways with median barriers represent a much smaller portion of crashes, suggesting that roadway design and pysical seperation play an important role in reducing collision risk.    </p>
